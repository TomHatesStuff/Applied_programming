# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

For my app i have decided that i need to create something that will help me with remembering important things like homework. I have created a flashcard app that will help the everyday student.

{Provide a description of your app.  Describe how to use the app.}

My app lets people add a question and answer which can then be displayed. the question shows first for the student to decide an answer then click rveal answer and see what the answer was.

{Describe your purpose for creating this app.}

The reason I created this app was because growing up I always had an issue remembering specific terms for school. Especially when I got older and began working ith coding languages. So hopefully this will help people become better at remembering certain terms. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the app}
I used the internet and videos to help develop this app. I spent hours looking over libraries and videos on the coding language. I also used my brain which is the most important tool.
{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
Xcode/ swiftUI 
this code is like a mix off python and css and is painfull to learn.
