# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description for the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Erlang language.}
I wrote a game of tic tac toe. It lets the user see the game board and place x and os on the board till three in a row wins them the game.
{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
the purpose of this code is so that the people who use it will be able to have fun and waste time playing it.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
I used 4 modules so for the game. the game logic the board, ouput and the exception handling.
{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
